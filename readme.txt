Mango/pineapple is for 6.2.0

Before 6.1.0 released:

    Branch "pineapple" is for 6.2.0. 
    Mango/master is till for 6.1.0. 
    Git "Mango/pineapple" will be synced back to svn:   http://svn1.sjc.sugarcrm.pvt/sugarcrm/branches/Pineapple 
    if you are looking for trunk, we can create another branch called "Mango/dev" for it.

After 6.1.0 released:

    Branch "pineapple" is still for 6.2.0. 
    Mango/master will be trunk (merge branch "dev" and 6.2.0 to it) 
    rename "mango" to "sugarcrm"
