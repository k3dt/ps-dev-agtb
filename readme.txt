***NOTICE - If you are seeing this message and aren't in the Mango/master branch, please update the readme.txt file to describe your branch instead.***

Mango/master will contain code for the last shipped release.  After we ship a release, we will merge the related release branch into this branch. If you are wanting to work on new code that isn't directly related to a release then you can make a branch off of Mango/master to do so and merge in back in wherever the engineering release manager for the associated release indicates to.

No direct commits should occur to this Mango/master.
