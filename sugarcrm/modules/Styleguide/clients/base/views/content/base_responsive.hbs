      <h3>What they do</h3>
      <p>Media queries allow for custom CSS based on a number of conditions&mdash;ratios, widths, display type, etc&mdash;but usually focuses around <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-width</code>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modify the width of column in our grid</li>
        <li>Stack elements instead of float wherever necessary</li>
        <li>Resize headings and text to be more appropriate for devices</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Media query code -->
  <h2>Using the media queries</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span5">
      <p>The framework doesn't automatically include these media queries, but understanding and adding them is very easy and requires minimal setup. You have a few options for including the responsive features:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the compiled responsive version, bootstrap-responsive.css</li>
        <li>Add @import "responsive.less" and recompile</li>
        <li>Modify and recompile responsive.less as a separate</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Why not just include it?</strong> Truth be told, not everything needs to be responsive. Instead of encouraging developers to remove this feature, we figure it best to enable it.</p>
