<h2>Summary</h2>
<span class="lead">
    Adds additional operations to <a onclick="openLongHelp('3d2524f2398c30db68af051c799f3c18');">Filter API</a> that are
    specific to Emails. A special macro, <b>$current_user_id</b>, is a convenience that allows for finding emails
    involving the current user.

<h4>Emails Sent By</h4>
<div class="well well-small">
    The <b>$from</b> operation allows you to find emails sent by one or more people. When the person is not known, only
    the email address is stored. In such a case, the <b>participant_module</b> is EmailAddresses and the
    <b>participant_id</b> is the ID of the email address from the database. In the example, you would find any emails
    sent by the current user, the Contacts record with ID "fa300a0e-0ad1-b322-9601-512d0983c19a", or the email address
    with ID "b0701501-1fab-8ae7-3942-540da93f5017".
