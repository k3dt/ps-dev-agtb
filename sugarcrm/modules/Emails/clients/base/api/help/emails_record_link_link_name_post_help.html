            Create related notes as attachments. <b>filename_guid</b> is used to specify the temporary
            file ID for an uploaded file that should be attached as a Notes record. <b>upload_id</b> is used to specify
            the ID of an existing file that the Notes record should reference as the attachment. This allows files to be
            shared by multiple records. When using <b>upload_id</b>, the <b>file_source</b> should be provided to
            indicate from where the file originated. The value should be the module of the record that shares its ID
            with the file. So when an attachment comes from an email template, the <b>file_source</b> should be
            <b>EmailTemplates</b>. And when an attachment comes from a document, the <b>file_source</b> should be
            <b>DocumentRevisions</b>.
