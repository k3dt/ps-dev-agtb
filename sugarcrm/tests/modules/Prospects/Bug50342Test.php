/**
 * Bug50342Test.php
 * This test helps simulate the calls made to the get_entry_list method of SoapSugarUsers.php.  For the searching
 * and merging of campaign related data via the Word plugin, there is some special code made to query the relationships.
 * In particular, one quirk is the passage of token search terms surrounded by hash marks.  The
 * testSoapSugarUsersGetEntryListValidateQuery method attempts to test theses queries that had previously been failing
 * because they violated the column name checks in SugarSQLValidate.
 *
 * Another problem was in the Prospect.php file.  For the select_fields that the retrieveTargetList method was
 * processing, we would use the module name as the table name.  This fails because the module name contains uppercase
 * letters whereas the table names are lowercase.  The testRetrieveTargetList attempts to test for this issue.
