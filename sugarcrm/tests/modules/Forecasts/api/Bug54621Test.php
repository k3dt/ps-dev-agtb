 * This is a test for the ForecastWorksheetManagerApi class.  We are testing that the getForecastValues method
 * returns the most recent forecast entry.  There is a bug with some MySQL implementation where the max(datetime)
 * function does not correctly return the most recent datetime and so we could not use that function in our code.
