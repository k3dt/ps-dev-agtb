/**
 * Bug 57210:
 * Need to be able to mark a related record 'deleted=1' when a file uploads fails.
 * delete_if_fails flag is an optional query string which can trigger this behavior. An example
 * use case might be: user's in a modal and client: 1. POST's related record 2. uploads file...
 * If the file was too big, the user may still want to go back and select a smaller file < max;
 * but now, upon saving, the client will attempt to PUT related record first and if their ACL's
 * may prevent edit/deletes it would fail. This rectifies such a scenario.
