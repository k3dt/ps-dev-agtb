    Run API calls in bulk.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<span class="lead">
    This request will run a sequence of API requests within one query. The requests are executed sequentially and their results
    are returned as one response. Some requests may return failure code, that does not interrupt the execution of the batch, 
    and the overall request will still be considered successful.
