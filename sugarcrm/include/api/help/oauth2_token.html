<div class="longHelpTitle">Provides an OAuth 2.0 compliant token endpoint</div>
<div class="summary">
<h2>Summary:</h2>
  This endpoint provides the token portion of the OAuth 2.0 specification. Currently the only supported grant types are "password" and "refresh_token". The client_id of "sugar" will automatically create an OAuth Key in the system and can be used for "password" authentication. The client_id of "support_portal" will create an OAuth Key if the portal system is enabled and will allow for portal authentication. Other client_id's can be created by the administrator in the OAuthKeys section in the Administration section and can be used in the future for additional grant types, if the client secret is filled in, it will be checked to validate use of the client id.
