    <h3>How Converting Works</h3>
    <p>To convert a lead you must associate a contact. You may also select and account and opportunity to convert a lead but these are not required.</p>
    <p>Duplicates may exist for contacts, accounts or opportunities. You can ignore them and create a new record or select one of the preexisting records.</p>
