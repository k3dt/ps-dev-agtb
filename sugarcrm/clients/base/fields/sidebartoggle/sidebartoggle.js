/**
 * Some events have been deprecated in 7.2 and removed.
 * List of changes:
 *
 * - `sidebarRendered` has been removed. Now, when the field renders it calls
 *    {@link Layout.Default#isSidePaneVisible} directly to get the current
 *    state.
 *
 * - `toggleSidebar` has been removed. Triggers `sidebar:toggle` instead.
 *
 * - `toggleSidebarArrows` has been removed. Listens to `sidebar:state:changed`
 *    instead.
 *
 * - `openSidebarArrows` has been removed. Listens to `sidebar:state:changed`
 *    instead.
 *
 * - The app event `app:toggle:sidebar` has been removed. Listen to
 *   `sidebar:state:changed` instead.
