  <!-- alias is used to make a copy of a distribution file to a location
       where it will be used.  Note that when you specify the Application
       name in the "to" attribute, you should specify the full path using
       the value of iisapp above for the root.  Alias doesn't actually
       copy the file within the package.  It creates an alias to the
       original file using the new file's path and name.  This alias then
       gets copied to the file system as if it were a real file within
       the package -->

  <alias from="web.config" to="SugarCE-Full-%SUGAR_VERSION%/web.config" />
